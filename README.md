In this one-day workshop, I had the opportunity to explore the exciting fields of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and RISC-V architecture. I learned about the chip manufacturing process and examined different types of chips and microprocessors. This experience was highly valuable, enhancing my knowledge of VLSI and chip design, and broadening my potential career paths in this area.
